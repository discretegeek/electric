    "Allows large shadow-cljs cache files.

  This Shadow hook will expand Jackson’s default max string size by `factor`.

  Shadow-cljs caches compiled cljs namespaces into transit-encoded json files.
  Electric e/def(n) can expand to a lot of clojure/script code. The Hyperfiddle
  team is working on improving the generated code size. In the meantime, we argue
  large code size is not an actual issue because:
  - server-side code size is not a constraint for the use case of Electric
  (long-living web apps),
  - client-side code size is efficiently optimized away by the Google Closure
  advanced compilation mode (e.g. shadow release),
  - gzip compression outshines most code size optimizations.

  However, code size matters in dev mode (e.g. shadow watch). Shadow will cache
  compiled cljs namespaces in transit-JSON format. Shadow caches the entire
  compiled js file as a JSON string. Transit reads and writes JSON with the
  Jackson library.

  Since Jackson 2.15, strings larger than 5Mb were rejected¹. The community
  quickly asked for this limit to be raised to 20Mb² and to be configurable³.
  These changes were released in Jackson 2.15.2.

  As of December 2023, Transit-java (and so Transit-clj) does not set a max string
  size and relies on defaults. We can therefore safely alter defaults for the 
  extent of a shadow compilation.

  For each compilation (dev and release), this shadow hook will:
  - Before compilation:
    - capture the current Jackson max string size limit,
    - set the limit to `default × factor`.
  - After compilation:
    - restore the captured max string size limit.
