; p/fn actually is not primitive. p/fn macroexpands to continuous flows with parameters injected
; through dynamic scope. Therefore, F (a Photon closure) is concretely a missionary continuous flow,
; whose argv must be injected by dynamic bindings, which is done by the special form (new).

; the problem is buffering, eduction has a buffer, whenever the buffer is full, eduction
; is ready to transfer. so if downstream doesn't sample and upstream emits again, eduction won't
; poll the input because the buffer is full, and when the sampling will happen you see the value
; inside the buffer (not the latest). so relieve ensures the buffers are flushed.
