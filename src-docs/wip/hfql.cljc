; Takeaways:
; 1. no REST, no GraphQL, all client/server network management handled automatically. Eliminates BFF problem
; 2. simple to understand, easy to use, unified programming model (multiplier for sr devs, and makes jr devs useful)
; 3. A consequence of this is it permits a data driven approach that enables us to build a low-code GUI on top of it.
